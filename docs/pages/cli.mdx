# Using the CLI

## Installation

The **Edge Runtime** can be also consumed from your terminal when you install it globally in your system:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    npm -g install edge-runtime
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    yarn -g add edge-runtime
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    pnpm install -g edge-runtime
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Usage

Providing `--repl` flag will start an interactive session. You can also run any arbitrary script:

```bash
edge-runtime examples/greetings
```

If you want to interact with it as an HTTP server, just pass the `--listen` flag:

```bash
edge-runtime examples/fetch --listen
```

For help with commands, check `edge-runtime --help`.
