# Edge Runtime Cookies

The **@edge-runtime/cookies** package provides high-level HTTP Cookie
abstractions for Edge-compatible environments, such as Edge Runtime or Vercel
Edge Functions and Edge Middleware.

The available methods are based on the [`CookieStore API`](https://wicg.github.io/cookie-store/#CookieStore).
The main difference is that the methods are not asynchronous so they do not return a `Promise`.

## Installation

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    npm install @edge-runtime/cookies --save
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    yarn add @edge-runtime/cookies
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    pnpm install @edge-runtime/cookies --save
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Usage

### for Request

To access and manipulate request cookies, use the exported `RequestCookies` constructor:

```ts
import { RequestCookies } from '@edge-runtime/cookies'

function handleRequest(req: Request) {
  const cookies = new RequestCookies(req.headers)
  cookies.get('cookie-name')?.value // undefined | string
  cookies.has('cookie-name') // boolean
  // do something...
}
```

Notes:

- All mutations are performed in place and will update the `Cookie` header in
  the provided `Request` object.

- When mutating the request cookies, the client won't be able to read the
  updated/deleted cookies. Please use `ResponseCookies` for that.

#### Available methods

- `get` - A method that takes a cookie `name` and returns an object with `name` and `value`. If a cookie with `name` isn't found, it returns `undefined`. If multiple cookies match, it will only return the first match. The cookie configuration (Max-Age, Path etc) is not being passed by the HTTP client, therefore it's not possible to determine the cookie expiration date.
- `getAll` - A method that is similar to `get`, but returns a list of all the cookies with a matching `name`. If `name` is unspecified, it returns all the available cookies.
- `set` - A method that takes an object with properties of `CookieListItem` as defined in the [W3C CookieStore API](https://wicg.github.io/cookie-store/#dictdef-cookielistitem) spec.
- `delete` - A method that takes either a cookie `name` or a list of names. and removes the cookies matching the name(s). Returns `true` for deleted and `false` for undeleted cookies.
- `has` - A method that takes a cookie `name` and returns a `boolean` based on if the cookie exists (`true`) or not (`false`).
- `clear` - A method that takes no argument and will effectively remove the `Cookie` header.

### for Response

To access and manipulate response cookies that will persist in the HTTP client,
use the exported `ResponseCookies` constructor:

```ts
import { ResponseCookies } from '@edge-runtime/cookies'

function handleRequest(req: Request) {
  // do something
  const cookies = new ResponseCookies(new Headers())
  cookies.set('cookie-name', 'cookie-value', { maxAge: 1000 }) // make cookie persistent for 1000 seconds
  cookies.delete('old-cookie')
  return response
}
```

Notes:

- All mutations are performed in-place and will update the `Set-Cookie` headers
  in the provided `Response` object.

#### Available methods

- `get` - A method that takes a cookie `name` and returns an object with `name` and `value`. If a cookie with `name` isn't found, it returns `undefined`. If multiple cookies match, it will only return the first match.
- `getAll` - A method that is similar to `get`, but returns a list of all the cookies with a matching `name`. If `name` is unspecified, it returns all the available cookies.
- `set` - A method that takes an object with properties of `CookieListItem` as defined in the [W3C CookieStore API](https://wicg.github.io/cookie-store/#dictdef-cookielistitem) spec.
- `delete` - A method that takes either a cookie `name` or a list of names. and removes the cookies matching the name(s). Returns `true` for deleted and `false` for undeleted cookies.
