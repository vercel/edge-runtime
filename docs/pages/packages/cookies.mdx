# Edge Runtime Cookies

The **@edge-runtime/cookies** package provides a high-level HTTP Cookie
abstractions for Edge-compatible environments, such as Edge Runtime or Vercel
Edge Functions and Edge Middleware.

## Installation

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey='selected-pkg-manager'>
  <Tab>

```
npm install @edge-runtime/cookies --save
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

```bash
yarn add @edge-runtime/cookies
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

```sh
pnpm install @edge-runtime/cookies --save
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Usage

### Request Cookie Handling

In order to read request cookie handling, use the exported `RequestCookies`
constructor:

```ts
import { RequestCookies } from '@edge-runtime/cookies'

function handleRequest(req: Request) {
  const cookies = new RequestCookies(req)
  cookies.get('cookie-name') // undefined | string
  cookies.has('cookie-name') // boolean
  // do something...
}
```

Notes:

- `cookies.get()` returns the value of the cookie. The cookie configuration
  (`Max-Age`, `Path` etc) is not being passed by the HTTP client, therefore it's
  not possible to determine the cookie expiration date.

- All mutations are performed in-place and will update the `cookie` header in
  the provided `Request` object.

- When mutating the request cookies, the client won't be able to read the
  updated/deleted cookies. Please use `ResponseCookies` for that.

### Response Cookie Handling

In order to manipulate response cookies that will persist in the HTTP client,
use the exported `ResponseCookies` constructor:

```ts
import { ResponseCookies } from '@edge-runtime/cookies'

function handleRequest(req: Request) {
  // do something
  const response = new Response('Hello, world.')
  const cookies = new ResponseCookies(response)
  cookies.set('cookie-name', 'cookie-value', { maxAge: 1000 }) // make cookie persistent for 1000 seconds
  cookies.delete('old-cookie')
  return response
}
```

Notes:

- `cookies.set()` sets a cookie with the provided name and value. The cookie
  configuration (`Max-Age`, `Path` etc) is passed as an optional argument.

- `cookies.delete()` deletes a cookie with the provided name by setting an empty
  value with an expiration date in the past.

- All mutations are performed in-place and will update the `Set-Cookie` headers
  in the provided `Response` object.
